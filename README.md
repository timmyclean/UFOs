# UFOs
## Are We Alone?
# Overview of Project
  * Intially, we helped create a webpage and dynamic table that used a date filter to search UfO sightingts data
  * We then were asked to help provide the end user with a more in-depth analysis by adding multiple criteria 
  * They included city, state, country, and shape along with the date filter.
# Results
  * As seen below the intial image is what the user would see when first entering the page

  * The user can then add citeria, once any criteria is added the table fliters and displays results. As an example we have entered Date "1/13/2010", "us", "triangle" as criteria. as seen in the image having the ability to really go in-depth can help narrow the search.

# Summary
  * In conclusion the website is very helpful in allowing a user to determine if and when there were UFO sightings around where you live in a specific period of time.
  * Having said that a drawback would be that it is a very specific period of time. 
  * The code is very good, and would be great if paired with a larger data set.
  * Also it would be interesting if the filter was a map of the world and you could point to an area on the map that would give you results of any UFO sightings.
